Something that has blown me away, is the way kids are who they are, and it shines through, as long as they aren't punished for it.

As this type of dialogue becomes louder, and more difficult to avoid, with high profile trans (genders and sexuals) out there demanding acceptance by being too fabulous to be ignored or written off, perhaps we'll reach the tipping point.

At that point, parents begin questioning, and perhaps schools begin to offer access to a school therapist with gender support training (yes, I made up that term, but you get the idea).

"Hm. ""Fewer people trapped by their genetically assigned gender"".

I'm going to make a separation here. Transgender and genderfluid people would be more common, I guess, or at least more visible, since people would be free to express their gender roles as they wish. But transsexual people would happen all the same, since I think there is something happening here in the inner levels of the brain, something that has to do with hormones and sex differentiation, something that is deeper than the conscious, cognitive levels of the human mind.

Let's put it this way: My mind stopped working properly as soon as it got the testosterone rush when I was around 10. I loathed my beard and my body. There was nothing I could do to look better to myself. Testosterone was ruining my skin, thinning my hair, ruining my voice... I had no use for my penis, and sperm was something disgusting.

Maybe some people who feel like this about their bodies would feel less pressured to seek medical remedies, since these remedies are expensive, painful, and they can be dangerous. Maybe they would not feel so bad if they had no access to them.

But let me pose a different question. Let's suppose that in a near future it is easier to have access to hormone treatments, surgery is better, less painful, cheaper, safer, etc. Let's suppose that this happens when there is total freedom about expressing the gender role we want.

OK, following this line... If this were commonly accepted, then it follows that medical support would be more readily available, much in the same way that breast reconstruction is now included on insurance, post mastectomy. There are also foundations to help provide money and care for those with cancer who don't have other options.

"My mom would make this delicious casserole that we always loved eating growing up.

She would cook up the ground beef with a minced onion. I think she would cook it with oregano, lots of garlic, salt, pepper, and i think that's it. While that's cooking, she'd make a pot of rice.

When they were ready, she'd mix them together into a casserole dish (sometimes she would layer them, then I did the mixing on my plate later!). She'd then put a bag of frozen green beans and a bag of frozen white corn on top and mix them together (the hot meat and rice defrosts the frozen veggies), then top with a healthy layer of shredded cheese. (One time she smothered it all with some mashed potatoes, making it like a shepherd's pie - it was amazing!)

Pop it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, and, voila!",idea,2015-07-22 20:27:33.530748-04,375,375,ihfDGk,7

"I come in contact with a lot of people. I have traveled a little and lived on both coasts. I was in the military for a short time, and served with people from all over the country and walks of life. I was raised in a family with many ethnicities, complexions and national origins. I have relatives who are out and proud on both sides, and we live all over the country. We are cops, activists, professors, lawyers, criminals, hustlers, military men and women, preachers, teachers, lovers and writers. My family does not always agree but we respect, love and support one another. We disagree but we don't harm or insult one another.

I say all this to say that I know that we are in tough times, folks are hurting and it is difficult sometimes to listen and respond lovingly. I've seen so many online debates go bad and good people who are great thinkers go completely batshit, lose all compassion and act out of their character.

Gigantazon isn't just a place to make ideas actionable. It's a place for innovative discussion, brainstorming with the crowd (crowdstorming), and an all-around better way to communicate on the Internet. And it does so on an online platform that more closely mimics in-person conversation.

Mapping online conversations in this way breaks away from the chronologically linear approach that has dominated all types of online discussion since the inception of the Internet. Te intuitive Gigantazon conversation also allows users to contribute their ideas at any time. Further, users visually see how a conversation develops with a uniquely designed user interface. This makes for a compelling platform and encourages users to actively participate and follow the development of Ideas, solving the world's biggest - and smallest - problems, and making the solutions available to others.

And that theme - the next big thing - was rolling around my mind as I was thinking about it. One of the topics was regarding potable water. I started thinking about how a family wasn't drinking safe water yesterday, but is today. That the solution was some kind of work around, maybe being shared from a friend, or even discovering the solution by themselves. I thought about how awesome it would be if that solution could have been crowdsourced - that a team of people with different experiences, education, and expertise could work together to solve a problem like this. I thought about what a great payoff it would be if that solution was reference in the future, and yet was left available to develop over time to grow with technology available. Once I slipped down that rabbit hole, I realized that was the big idea.",spark,2015-12-01 18:02:16.713529-05,477,476,PKqzWL,7
"Problem statement.

I cringe when someone tells me that ideas are cheap. Even the ideas that never produce anything take time and brainpower and even some dreaming. Everyone's time is valuable, so spinning ideas through your mind is valuable too. So how can they be cheap?

Not to diminish the intrinsic value of ideas and the effort they require, but they're cheap because there are so many of them. Let's say that everyone has just one great idea. There are 7 billion people on the planet. That means that there are 7 billion great ideas. Most of which will never be acted upon.

Gigantazon is here to help people make their ideas actionable, to shorten the distance between inception and execution. We connect the expertise to the ideas in an intuitive fashion so that ideas can come to life. ",spark,2015-12-01 19:35:34.237869-05,477,476,DIavcV,7

"The target market of Gigantazon: Gigantazon Market Analysis

An excerpt:
From a broad perspective, Gigantazon does not discriminate in the type of user. Accepting to anyone with or wishing to develop an idea, the world is open. However, not everyone is willing to share their idea on any online platform. As we refine the ideal customer for Gigantazon, we are faced with a young adult age range – first adopters who are adept in technology. Generations X and Y are also ideal candidates because of their general desire of making a positive impact in the world. The range is still broad, from young adults to middle age (18-47). This is an important distinction, to allow for the creativity in idealism of the youth and experience of the middle age users to blend and make the execution of ideas more likely.

That set of values helps to determine the target market for Gigantazon as well, users who are interested in Crowdsourcing, Brainstorming, Social, Open, and Disruptive Innovation, Co-creation, Ideation, and Social Impact and Collaboration – or, simply, Changemakers (people wanting to change the world for the better). Since being tech-savvy is an important element, we are also seeking people who participate in hackathons, a growing trend. For the purposes of this business plan, we are targeting the United States as the numbers are easier to define. However, in practice, we will be growing beyond, searching internationally for like-minded individuals.",spark,2015-12-10 19:23:58.765827-05,486,476,BrG6rH,7
"Service: Individual Participation: Freemium services for the crowd. Users publicly post their ideas for free, allowing other users to develop it, bringing it to a point of execution.

Additionally, the users necessary to share their education, expertise, and experience become the crowd from which the ideas are developed. Not only do you have the idea originators, but also the idea developers.

This service is free, but there are premium features available at cost (either money or points). The monthly a la carte fees will vary, but the standard all-inclusive annualized monthly membership is estimated to be around $8 a month. We will first roll out privatized ideas, a single idea portal available by invite only. We are next imagining public profiles, making users searchable if they want to be. These will continue to develop in the community, as the software is open source, and additional features will be determined at that time.

The value of using Gigantazon is to move rapidly through the divergence phase of idea development.

"How Competitors Address the Problem

Regarding how these companies are addressing the problem, each approach from a slightly different tact. Quora and reddit are straight-up forums, where people can ask questions and post general statements. Ideatrr is similar in intention, but the community base is smaller, seeking users contributing big, world changing ideas. OpenIDEO takes on projects and shares it to the community, similarly minded. Quirky looks to capitalize on the product development of the ideas, taking them to market. And Ideator wants to turn them all into businesses. So, aspects of each are similar to that of Gigantazon - from community to intention, but Gigantazon’s tool/platform is unlike any other solution currently on the market.

Looking at the broader competition, all of them touch on different aspects of driving social innovation and collaboration, but none comprehensively bring the aspects together in an intuitive package. They are still driven by the user, not the content. The applications are chronological, meaning that potentially revolutionary insights may get buried. Although operating under different philosophies, they are quite similar in experience.

Not only is this approach compelling, but there is much more data to be pulled from the contributions. It is a content-driven platform, so we do not have voting or 'likes' on Gigantazon. This is important to allow users to contribute substantive posts (think quality over quantity). The combination of those factors (mapped conversations and quality posts), make the analytics compelling. The maturation of the product will include semantic and sentiment analysis, gamification, and additional features.",idea,2015-12-11 17:56:30.001517-05,506,476,Fh5bnO,7
"Legal Structure

Gigantazon will file as a Limited Liability Company in early 2016. We are determining the best route for the company, first taking into account our mission, vision, and values, then financial considerations.

To that point, we think that the collective corporation best aligns with our mission, vision, and values. However, we're uncertain how the corporate structure would impact our organization.

The next closest in alignment is the Benefit Corporation structure.

Finally, being a tech company, a regular C-Corp is still within the scope of possibilities.

Really, we need some further research and insight before converting.",idea,2015-12-11 18:22:45.120168-05,489,476,3LusuT,7

"Who Uses Gigantazon: The initial set of user personas.

The Starter: Users who don't know where to even start with their great idea.
The Sticker: Users who got stuck along the way.
The Sparker: Users who access much information and quickly disseminates it.
The Notioner: Users who strive to understand the Idea within its context before extrapolating on it.
The Doer: Users who do the work on Ideas.
The Helper: Users who are passionate about very particular, but usually broad-reaching, topics (like world peace).
The Enterprise: Companies who purposes may fit within or tap into the above categories.",spark,2015-12-03 18:28:27.352856-05,477,476,auUmVx,7

"Gigantazon Target Market:
From a broad perspective, Gigantazon does not discriminate in the type of user. Accepting to anyone with or wishing to develop an idea, the world is open. However, not everyone is willing to share their idea on any online platform. Generations X and Y are our ideal candidates' age range because of their general desire of making a positive impact in the world and their utilization of technology. The range is still broad, from young adults to middle age (18-47). This is an important distinction, to allow for the creativity in idealism of the youth and experience of the middle age users to blend and to easier facilitate the execution of ideas.

That set of values helps to determine the target market for Gigantazon, users who are interested in Crowdsourcing, Brainstorming, Social, Open, and Disruptive Innovation, Co-creation, Ideation, and Social Impact and Collaboration - or, simply, Changemakers (people wanting to change the world for the better). Since being tech-savvy is an important element, we are also seeking people who participate in hackathons, a growing trend. For the purposes of this business plan, we are targeting the United States as the numbers are easier to define. However, in practice, we will be growing beyond, searching internationally for like-minded individuals.",idea,2015-12-11 16:21:43.306442-05,486,476,t8y6FD,7
"Near-Term Market Opportunity:Compiling that information yields a near-term customer range of about 900,000. At a targeted conversion rate of 1%-3%, that creates between 9,000 and 27,000 active users on Gigantazon. As the application generates more content, the target market will increase by taking on additional and newly defined demographics. Such as new adopters from similar forums that are seeking a particular way to engage innovation for social good.  (These figures were calculated based on an indicative sample on Facebook ads.)",idea,2015-12-11 16:22:52.859306-05,486,476,b1O91e,7
"Service: Enterprise Software as a Service: Repositories for groups and organizations. Individuals, groups, or companies purchase a repository upon which only its users can view and contribute. All repositories will be branded to the owner and the baseline of features are available at all levels: Unlimited contributions and Idea Maps, advanced reporting, SSL encryption, role-based permissions. The groups will receive personalized on-boarding, advanced reporting, single sign-on support, data continuity, and user management. Other features and services will be added over time. The level of support (online, premium, and dedicated) and expense will change depending on the number of users and services expected.

For groups up to 50 members, a private repository will cost $175 per month. Enterprise portals are priced per employee per month on a sliding scale depending on the number of users: Up to 100 employees at $6.25 each, up to 500 at $3.25, up to 1,000 at $2.25, and 5,000 and beyond at $1.25.
Inherently, this changes the applicability of the platform, moving it beyond just the divergence aspect of idea development and into emergence as well. This drastically improves organizational innovation, the value proposition of this service. Beyond requests for improvements (tickets), the data will show how Gigantazon for the enterprise is best utilized and can then guide feature development, leading to additional services.",idea,2015-12-11 16:09:37.896092-05,493,476,Dp2YJL,7
"Service: Open Source Software Services: Implementation and support services. The software is available for all, as it is open source. This is to encourage the users of Gigantazon to create features they most wish to see - and allows the crowd to shape its tool to best fit its needs. Implementing the software and ongoing support, however, can be tricky. For that reason, Gigantazon also offers Professional Services to work with organizations to ensure the greatest satisfaction and ease of use.

The value proposition in so doing is to help other websites use this flexible, intuitive, and powerful tool in other applications. As people start to see the benefit of mapping conversations, this software will start to replace the chronological listing for comments.

The pricing will be in line with the market value for these services, however it is yet to be estimated.",idea,2015-12-11 16:10:12.087598-05,493,476,lG8OsJ,7

"How the Market Has Changed:The market for these services has changed in that there are far more competitors than before. As tech matures, this will be the case. The market continues to change because of the amount of focus on social good and improvement of offers. The market share is increasing as more customers see the need for virtual collaboration. There are also more direct competitors to the Gigantazon platform. The main difference, however, is that the target market (Generations Y and, soon, Z) do most of their computing on mobile phones and tablets. As more companies embrace the need to stand for a generally good purpose, they will push to engage with the customer more and more. These are the largest factors driving change in the market.",idea,2015-12-11 17:14:00.353548-05,486,476,RhN34M,7
